This type of note carries less risk to the lender and usually allows the borrower to pay a lesser interest rate."

"An unsecured promissory note is a document that details the borrowing of money from one individual or entity to another without security if the debt is not paid in full. Unlike a secured promissory note, the lender is taking into account the borrowerâ€™s credibility without receiving anything in return if they shall default on their payments. Typically, payment is structured on a weekly or monthly basis with installments made by specific dates and without pre-payment penalties."
